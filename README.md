# RenderMan RIB Project @ Bournemouth University

## Overview
This project was developed during my MSc in Computer Animation and Visual Effects course, focusing on **RenderMan Interface Bytestream (RIB)** scripting for rendering scenes using **Pixar's RenderMan**. The project explores procedural rendering, shading, and lighting using **RenderMan's RIB format** and scripting techniques.

## Concepts Learned

1. **RenderMan Interface Bytestream (RIB)**
   - Understanding the **RIB file format** for defining scenes.
   - Writing and optimising RIB scripts for procedural rendering.
   - Structuring a scene using geometric primitives, transformations, and shaders.

2. **Shading & Material Definition**
   - Using **RenderMan Shading Language (RSL)** to create custom shaders.
   - Implementing surface, displacement, and volume shaders.
   - Applying **BSDF models** and physically-based rendering techniques.

3. **Lighting & Global Illumination**
   - Exploring **RenderManâ€™s light types** (Area, Spot, Dome, etc.).
   - Implementing **Ray-Traced Global Illumination** and **Path Tracing**.
   - Configuring **shadowing techniques** for realistic lighting.
